# HyperShop

> Simple shopping Cart Demo SPA built using Hyperapp/Hyperapp Router

I had worked on this to learn the basics of hyperapp and it's awesome state management features

You can fork this And give it a run.


```
npm install   // Install all dependencies
npm start     // Serve app on localhost and watch source files
```

This will build the application and serve it on http://localhost:8080


## This SPA was built using

- Hyperapp JS V1
- Hyperapp Router
- Hyperapp Transitions
- Bulma for Styling
