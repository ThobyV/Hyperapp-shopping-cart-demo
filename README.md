# HyperShop

> Simple movie-based shopping Cart Demo SPA built using Hyperapp/Hyperapp Router/Hyperapp Transitions

I had worked on this to learn the basics of ```hyperapp``` and it's awesome state management/virtual DOM rendering and Component routing features. It's a repo meant for an introductory tutorial on hyperapp js.

Live demo: https://thobyv.github.io/Hyperapp-shopping-cart-demo/

You can clone this project and give it a run.

#npm commands

npm install   // Install all dependencies
npm start     // Serve app on localhost and watch source files

```
